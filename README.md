# hfht's website

An Angular web app meant to live at my domain, [hfht.moe](https://hfht.moe). Currently, the 'main' branch simply displays a banner and "under construction". The most recent changes are hosted on the branch local-develop.

It's primarily purpose is to allow users to submit posts (a combination of text, tags, and so on) to my server, which lives [here](https://github.com/ntriche/hfht-server) on Github.

This project is under active development.

## Installation and such

Install as usual

```bash
$ npm install
```

And run `ng serve` for a development server.
